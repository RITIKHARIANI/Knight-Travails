# Knight-Travails
PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given a standard 8x8 chessboard, design a C application that accepts two squares identified by numeric chess notation. The first square is the starting position, and the second square is the ending position. Find the shortest sequence of valid moves to take a Knight piece from the starting position to the ending position. Each move must be a legal move by a Knight. For any two squares there may be more than one valid solution. A Knight moves two steps in a straight line from its starting position, and then one square to either the left or right. A Knight can jump over other pieces.

To run the code, any C compiler running the latest versions would be sufficient.
